### Iteration 1: T1 — Define state types and YAML serialization
**Completed:** Created `internal/state/` package with `types.go` containing all foundation types:
- `PlanStatus` enum (draft, ready, active, blocked, complete) with `IsValid()` method
- `TaskStatus` enum (todo, claimed, doing, blocked, done, skipped) with `IsValid()` method
- `PlanState` struct with ID, Title, Status, CreatedAt, Tasks, Feedback
- `TaskState` struct with ID, Title, Description, Status, Requires, Criteria, Notes, Artifacts, StartedAt, DoneAt
- `Criterion` struct with Text, Done, DoneAt
- `Artifacts` struct with Commits, FilesTouched
- `Feedback` struct with ID, Scope, Author, Message, Resolved, ResolvedAt, CreatedAt
- All fields have both `yaml` and `json` struct tags
- Created `types_test.go` with 7 tests: IsValid for both enums, YAML round-trip, JSON round-trip, JSON output verification, YAML output verification, empty optional fields round-trip

**Gotcha:** YAML `omitempty` is needed on the `Feedback` slice field in `PlanState` — without it, a nil slice serializes as `feedback: []` and deserializes as `[]Feedback{}`, breaking `reflect.DeepEqual` round-trip checks. Fixed by adding `omitempty` to both YAML and JSON tags.
**Next:** T2 (state load/save with atomic writes) or T3 (validation rules) — both depend only on T1 which is now complete.
