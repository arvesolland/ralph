# Loose Format Plan

This plan doesn't follow the strict Ralph format but should still work.

## What needs to be done

### Task 1: Make a file

Create a file called `output/loose-test.txt` with the text "loose format works".

Status: not started

### Task 2: Make another file (after Task 1)

Create `output/loose-test-2.txt` with "second file done".

Depends on: Task 1
Status: waiting
