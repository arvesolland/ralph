  ## Why It's Incomplete
  
  The plan is essentially at the **starting gate**. T9 is marked complete but has **no actual code implementation yet** — it represents the task specification that was previously extracted from the original bash implementation. All foundational work (T1–T46) remains `open` with 0 checkboxes checked. Not a single Go file, dependency, or implementation exists. This is a fresh plan ready for execution.

  ## Analysis: All Tasks Are Incomplete
  
  **All 46 tasks are NOT complete.** Every single task in the plan has **Status: open** and zero checkboxes marked as complete. Let me break this down:
  
  ### Task Status Summary
  
  | Phase | Task | Status | Issue |
  |-------|------|--------|-------|
  | Phase 1 | T1-T3 | open | All checkboxes unchecked |
  | Phase 2 | T4-T7 | open | All checkboxes unchecked |
  | Phase 3 | T8-T14 | open | All checkboxes unchecked |
  | Phase 4 | T15-T21 | open | All checkboxes unchecked |
  | Phase 5 | T22-T28 | open | All checkboxes unchecked |
  | Phase 6 | T29-T31 | open | All checkboxes unchecked |
  | Phase 7 | T32-T36 | open | All checkboxes unchecked |
  | Phase 8 | T37-T41 | open | All checkboxes unchecked |
  | Phase 9 | T42-T46 | open | All checkboxes unchecked |
  
  ### Why This Was Flagged as Incomplete
  
  This appears to be a fresh plan file that was just created (2026-01-31). The plan itself is a comprehensive Go rewrite specification with 46 tasks across 9 phases, but **not a single checkbox has been marked complete**, and **no tasks have been moved to the "Completed" section**.
  
  ### Next Steps
  
  The first task to tackle would be **T1: Initialize Go module and project structure**, which:
  - Has no dependencies (`Requires: —`)
  - Has 5 subtasks that must be completed sequentially
  - Is foundational for all other work (other tasks depend on it)
  
  All other tasks depend on earlier phases, so this is the only task available to start.

  ## Task Completion Analysis
  
  **All 46 tasks are NOT complete.** Every single task has **Status: open** with zero checkboxes marked complete.
  
  ### Why this plan is flagged as incomplete:
  
  The plan shows **zero progress** across all phases:
  
  | Phase | Tasks | Status |
  |-------|-------|--------|
  | Phase 1: Project Foundation | T1-T3 | All `open` |
  | Phase 2: Configuration System | T4-T7 | All `open` |
  | Phase 3: Plan Management | T8-T14 | All `open` |
  | Phase 4: Git Operations | T15-T21 | All `open` |
  | Phase 5: Claude Execution | T22-T28 | All `open` |
  | Phase 6: Core Loop | T29-T31 | All `open` |
  | Phase 7: Worker Queue | T32-T36 | All `open` |
  | Phase 8: Slack Integration | T37-T41 | All `open` |
  | Phase 9: Release & Polish | T42-T46 | All `open` |
  
  ### No criteria are met for ANY task:
  
  - **T1** (Initialize Go module): No `go.mod`, no directory structure, no build output
  - **T2** (Logging): No `internal/log/logger.go`, no logging implementation
  - **T3** (Cobra CLI): No Cobra setup, no root command, no CLI framework
  - **T4-T46**: All subsequent tasks also have zero progress
  
  ### Execution Status:
  
  The plan itself shows **Status: pending** (line 5), meaning it hasn't been assigned to a worker yet. This is a fresh plan file with zero implementation work started.
  
  **Next steps:** The plan is ready to be activated by the worker queue and execution should begin with T1 (which has no dependencies and can start immediately).

- [2026-01-31 08:40] **Verification failed:**
  Based on my analysis of the plan file, **ALL 46 TASKS ARE INCOMPLETE**. Every single task shows `**Status:** open` with all checkboxes unchecked.
  
  ## Summary of Non-Completion

  **Phase 8: Slack Integration** (Tasks T37-T41)
  - **T37-T41**: All 5 tasks incomplete (0 checkboxes each)
  
  **Phase 9: Release & Polish** (Tasks T42-T46)
  - **T42-T46**: All 5 tasks incomplete (0 checkboxes each)
  
  ## Why This Plan Is Flagged as Incomplete
  
  The plan exists as a comprehensive specification document with zero implementation. According to the plan's own rules (section "Rules"), task completion requires "All 'Done when' checked → set Status: `complete`". Since no checkboxes are marked and all task statuses remain `open`, the entire plan is incomplete and ready for work to begin.
  
  The `Discovered` and `Completed` sections are also empty, indicating no work has begun.

- [2026-01-31 08:35] **Verification failed:**
  Based on my review of the plan file, here's a summary of the incomplete tasks:
  
  ## **ALL 46 TASKS ARE INCOMPLETE**
  
  **Status Summary:**
  - **Total tasks:** 46
  - **Marked "open":** 46
  - **Marked "complete":** 0
  - **All have 0% of checkboxes checked** across all "Done when" criteria
  
  ## Key Incomplete Tasks by Phase:
  
  ### **Phase 1: Project Foundation** (Tasks 1-3)
  - **T1**: Go module initialization - No checkboxes marked
    - Requires: `go.mod`, directory structure, `main.go`, .gitignore updates
  - **T2**: Structured logging - No implementation
    - Requires: Logger interface, color support, log level filtering
  - **T3**: Cobra CLI framework - Not set up
    - Requires: root command, global flags, version subcommand
  
  ### **Phase 2: Configuration System** (Tasks 4-7)
  - **T4**: Config struct & YAML loading - Not implemented
  - **T5**: Project auto-detection - Not implemented
  - **T6**: Prompt template builder - Not implemented
  - **T7**: `ralph init` command - Not implemented
  
  ### **Phase 3: Plan Management** (Tasks 8-14)
  - **T8-T14**: Plan parsing, task extraction, queue management, progress/feedback files, status command
    - All have zero checkboxes marked
    - Complete foundation for plan execution system is missing
  
  ### **Phase 4: Git Operations** (Tasks 15-21)
  - **T15-T21**: Git interface, worktree operations, file sync, init hooks, cleanup
    - All foundational git/worktree functionality uncompleted
  
  ### **Phase 5: Claude Execution** (Tasks 22-28)
  - **T22-T28**: Command builder, streaming parser, retry logic, runner, completion detection, verification
    - Core Claude CLI integration entirely missing
  
  ### **Phase 6: Core Loop** (Tasks 29-31)
  - **T29-T31**: Iteration context, main loop, `ralph run` command
    - The heart of the system not yet built
  
  ### **Phase 7: Worker Queue** (Tasks 32-36)
  - **T32-T36**: Worker loop, completion workflows (PR/merge), `ralph worker` and `ralph reset` commands
    - Queue processing system not implemented
  
  ### **Phase 8: Slack Integration** (Tasks 37-41)
  - **T37-T41**: Webhook notifications, thread tracking, Bot API, Socket Mode, worker integration
    - All Slack functionality absent
  
  ### **Phase 9: Release & Polish** (Tasks 42-46)
  - **T42-T46**: GoReleaser, Homebrew tap, README, integration tests, CLAUDE.md updates
    - Distribution and documentation not started
  
  ## Why It's Flagged Incomplete:
  
  The plan shows **`Status: pending`** at the top and every single task is marked **`Status: open`** with zero progress. According to the plan's own completion rule:
  
  > "Task complete when: All 'Done when' checked → set Status: `complete`"
  
  Since **no checkboxes are checked on any task**, and no tasks have `Status: complete`, the entire plan is at 0% completion. This is a comprehensive rewrite project that hasn't been started yet.
