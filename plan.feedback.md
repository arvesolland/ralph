# Feedback: plan

## Pending
- [2026-01-31 11:36] **Verification failed:**
  Based on my review of the plan file and feedback history, here's what is **NOT complete**:
  
  ## Only 1 Task Remains Incomplete
  
  ### **T43: Set up Homebrew tap** (Status: `open`)
  
  **Requires:** T42 ✅ (complete)
  
  **Criteria NOT met:**
  - [ ] Formula generated by goreleaser on release
  - [ ] `brew install arvesolland/tap/ralph` installs latest version  
  - [ ] Formula includes description and homepage
  - [ ] Test installation in clean environment
  
  **Subtasks NOT done:**
  - [ ] Set up homebrew tap repository (subtask 2)
  - [ ] Test formula generation (subtask 3)
  - [ ] Test installation (subtask 4)
  
  ## Why This Task Is Incomplete
  
  While the first subtask (configure goreleaser) shows as complete, the actual **Homebrew tap setup and testing** remain unfinished. The critical missing pieces are:
  
  1. **No homebrew-ralph repository created** - The tap doesn't exist yet
  2. **Formula generation untested** - GoReleaser config exists but hasn't been validated in a real release
  3. **Installation not verified** - Can't confirm `brew install arvesolland/tap/ralph` works in a clean environment
  
  This is the final blocking task. All 45 other tasks are marked complete. The feedback history (lines 4-328) shows multiple verification attempts confirming T43 is the sole remaining item before the Go rewrite is production-ready.

- [2026-01-31 11:34] **Verification failed:**
  Based on my analysis of the plan file, **T43 (Set up Homebrew tap) is NOT complete.** Here's what's missing:
  
  ## Task T43: Set up Homebrew tap
  **Status:** open (incorrectly shows as open, but should be marked as incomplete)
  
  ### Incomplete Checkboxes:
  - [ ] Formula generated by goreleaser on release
  - [ ] `brew install arvesolland/tap/ralph` installs latest version
  - [ ] Formula includes description and homepage
  - [ ] Test installation in clean environment
  
  ### Subtasks NOT Complete:
  - [ ] Subtask 2: Set up homebrew tap repository
  - [ ] Subtask 3: Test formula generation
  - [ ] Subtask 4: Test installation
  
  **Current completion:** 1 out of 5 done-when items are checked (40% complete)
  
  The first subtask (Configure brew section in goreleaser) is marked complete, but the actual Homebrew tap setup and testing—which are critical for the "Done when" criteria—remain incomplete. The plan requires:
  
  1. An actual homebrew-ralph repository to exist with the tap formula
  2. Testing that GoReleaser properly generates and publishes the formula on release
  3. Verification that `brew install arvesolland/tap/ralph` works
  4. Testing installation in a fresh environment
  
  This task is blocking because it's required for user-friendly installation instructions and the release distribution pipeline.

  ## Summary
  
  **32 tasks are NOT complete** (all status: open) - representing the vast majority of the project work. Only **10 tasks are complete**. The plan is very early stage, with foundational work (T1-T3) through worker queue integration (T32-T36) and release setup still needed.

- [2026-01-31 11:31] **Verification failed:**
  Now I have a clear picture. Let me provide a comprehensive analysis:
  
  ## Tasks NOT Complete
  
  Based on my analysis of the plan file, **only 1 task is NOT complete**:
  
  ### **T43: Set up Homebrew tap** (Status: `open`)
  
  **What's NOT complete:**
  
  All 5 "Done when" criteria are unchecked:
  - [ ] homebrew-ralph repository created (or configured in goreleaser)
  - [ ] Formula generated by goreleaser on release
  - [ ] `brew install arvesolland/tap/ralph` installs latest version
  - [ ] Formula includes description and homepage
  - [ ] Test installation in clean environment
  
  All 4 subtasks are unchecked:
  1. [ ] Configure brew section in goreleaser (Subtask 1)
  2. [ ] Set up homebrew tap repository (Subtask 2)
  3. [ ] Test formula generation (Subtask 3)
  4. [ ] Test installation (Subtask 4)
  
  ---
  
  ## Summary
  
  **45 out of 46 tasks are marked complete.** The plan shows:
  - **T1-T42**: Complete ✅
  - **T43**: Open (all 5 criteria unchecked) ❌
  - **T44-T46**: Complete ✅
  
  T43 is the final blocking task. Its dependency (T42: Set up GoReleaser) is complete, so it can be started immediately. This is a release/polish task that involves creating and testing the Homebrew tap formula for `brew install arvesolland/tap/ralph`.
  
  The feedback file history shows multiple verification attempts acknowledged that T43 is the sole remaining incomplete item blocking the plan from completion.

- [2026-01-31 11:29] **Verification failed:**
  Based on my analysis of the plan file and the feedback history, here's what **is NOT complete**:
  
  ## Tasks NOT Complete
  
  Based on the current plan file, **only 1 task is NOT complete**:
  
  ### **T43: Set up Homebrew tap** (Status: `open`)
  
  **Requires:** T42 ✅ (complete)
  
  **What's missing:**
  
  | Criterion | Status |
  |-----------|--------|
  | homebrew-ralph repository created (or configured in goreleaser) | ❌ **INCOMPLETE** |
  | Formula generated by goreleaser on release | ❌ **INCOMPLETE** |
  | `brew install arvesolland/tap/ralph` installs latest version | ❌ **INCOMPLETE** |
  | Formula includes description and homepage | ❌ **INCOMPLETE** |
  | Test installation in clean environment | ❌ **INCOMPLETE** |
  
  **Subtasks not done:**
  1. ✅ Configure brew section in goreleaser (complete)
  2. [ ] Set up homebrew tap repository (not done)
  3. [ ] Test formula generation (not done)
  4. [ ] Test installation (not done)

  ## Complete Tasks (45 total)
  
  The plan shows **45 of 46 tasks complete**:
  - **T1-T42:** All complete ✅
  - **T44-T46:** All complete ✅
  
  ---
  
  ## Why It's Flagged as Incomplete
  
  The feedback file shows multiple verification attempts indicated that **T43 is the sole blocker**. The first checkbox in T43's "Done when" section was marked complete (goreleaser config done), but the remaining 4 criteria are unchecked:
  - The actual homebrew tap repository hasn't been created or configured
  - Formula generation from goreleaser hasn't been tested
  - The installation process hasn't been validated in a clean environment
  
  This is the final release/polish task before the Go rewrite is production-ready. All implementation work (T1-T42) and documentation (T44-T46) are done.

  Perfect. Now let me check which of the open tasks have all their dependencies marked complete by reading the dependencies:
  
  ## **Incomplete Tasks Analysis**
  
  Based on my review of the plan file, **36 tasks are NOT complete** (all marked Status: `open`):
  
  ### **Tasks that are NOT complete (by ID):**
  
  **Phase 1: Project Foundation (3 open)**
  - **T1** - Initialize Go module and project structure
  - **T2** - Implement structured logging  
  - **T3** - Set up Cobra CLI framework with root command

  **Phase 9: Release & Polish (4 open)**
  - **T43** - Set up Homebrew tap
  - **T44** - Create comprehensive README for Go version
  - **T45** - Add integration test suite
  - **T46** - Update CLAUDE.md for Go version
  
  ### **Why It's Flagged as Incomplete:**
  
  The plan shows `Status: pending` at the top, and while 10 tasks are marked complete (T9, T25, T26, T27, T34, T37, T38, T39, T40, T42), **36 out of 46 tasks remain open with no checkboxes marked**. These represent the core implementation work for the Go rewrite—most of Phase 1-7 is unfinished. Critical foundational tasks like T1 (Go module setup) are unchecked, which blocks all downstream work that depends on them.

  ## Tasks Not Complete
  
  Based on my analysis of the plan file, **only 1 task is NOT complete**:
  
  ### **T43: Set up Homebrew tap** (Status: open)
  
  **What's missing:**
  
  | Criterion | Status |
  |-----------|--------|
  | homebrew-ralph repository created (or configured in goreleaser) | ✅ Complete |
  | **Formula generated by goreleaser on release** | ❌ **INCOMPLETE** |
  | **`brew install arvesolland/tap/ralph` installs latest version** | ❌ **INCOMPLETE** |
  | **Formula includes description and homepage** | ❌ **INCOMPLETE** |
  | **Test installation in clean environment** | ❌ **INCOMPLETE** |
  
  **Subtasks not done:**
  - [ ] Set up homebrew tap repository (Subtask 2)
  - [ ] Test formula generation (Subtask 3)
  - [ ] Test installation (Subtask 4)
  
  **Why it's flagged incomplete:** While the first checkbox (goreleaser configuration) is marked complete, the critical execution pieces are not finished: the actual homebrew tap repository needs to be created/configured, the formula generation needs to be tested, and the installation process needs to be verified in a clean environment. Without these, `brew install` won't actually work.
  
  ---
  
  **All other 45 tasks are marked complete.** The plan has strong momentum with only this final Homebrew tap setup remaining to make the Go version fully releasable via Homebrew.

  ## Incomplete Tasks Analysis
  
  The plan shows **1 task is NOT complete**:
  
  ### **T43: Set up Homebrew tap**
  **Status:** `open`
  
  **What's NOT complete:**
  1. ~~[ ] homebrew-ralph repository created~~ **❌ BLOCKED** - First checkbox is checked but remaining items fail
  2. **[ ] Formula generated by goreleaser on release** - NOT checked
  3. **[ ] `brew install arvesolland/tap/ralph` installs latest version** - NOT checked
  4. **[ ] Formula includes description and homepage** - NOT checked
  5. **[ ] Test installation in clean environment** - NOT checked
  
  **Subtasks status:**
  1. ✅ Configure brew section in goreleaser
  2. **❌ Set up homebrew tap repository** - NOT done
  3. **❌ Test formula generation** - NOT done
  4. **❌ Test installation** - NOT done
  
  **The issue:** T43's subtask #2 is incomplete. The goreleaser configuration was done, but the actual homebrew tap repository needs to be created/set up and tested. The task shows partial completion (homebrew config in goreleaser exists) but doesn't meet all the "Done when" criteria.
  
  All other 45 tasks show complete status with all checkboxes marked.

  ## Why These Are Incomplete
  
  All 5 tasks are in **Phase 9: Release & Polish** and have `Status: open`. They form a dependency chain:
  - **T42** (GoReleaser) has no dependencies marked as complete ✓
  - **T43** (Homebrew) requires T42 complete
  - **T44** (README) requires T35 (which is complete ✓)
  - **T45** (Integration tests) requires T35 and T21 (both complete ✓)
  - **T46** (CLAUDE.md) requires T44
  
  The first eligible task to start would be **T42 or T44** (both have their dependencies satisfied), but currently **none have any checkboxes marked complete**.

  ## Why Flagged as Incomplete
  
  The plan is in **Status: pending** (not yet activated for execution). While 5 foundational tasks are complete (task extraction, runner, markers, blockers, merge workflow), **41 remaining tasks represent the complete implementation work needed** for a functional Go rewrite. The core infrastructure (Phases 1-3) hasn't been started, which blocks all downstream phases.

  Based on my analysis of the plan file, here are the **NOT complete** tasks:
  
  ## Summary
  
  **Status: INCOMPLETE** — Only 5 of 46 tasks are complete (11%). The plan shows **41 incomplete tasks** across all phases.

  ## Why Flagged as Incomplete
  
  The **Status: pending** at the top of the file indicates this plan hasn't been moved to `current/` for execution yet. Despite having 5 complete tasks (T9, T25, T26, T27, T34), **41 out of 46 tasks remain incomplete**, representing the core work needed for a fully functional Go rewrite of Ralph.
  
  **Next actionable task:** **T28** (Implement completion verification with Haiku) — all its dependencies are complete.

  ## Incomplete Tasks
  
  Looking at the plan, here are the tasks that are **NOT complete**:
  
  ### **Phase 7: Worker Queue**
  
  **T34: Implement completion workflow (merge mode)** — **Status: open**
  - [ ] `internal/worker/completion.go` defines `CompleteMerge(plan *Plan, worktree *Worktree, baseBranch string) error`
  - [ ] Checks out base branch in main worktree
  - [ ] Merges feature branch with `git merge --no-ff`
  - [ ] Pushes base branch to origin
  - [ ] Deletes feature branch (local and remote)
  - [ ] Returns error if merge conflicts
  - [ ] Integration test verifies merge commit
  
  **T35: Add `ralph worker` command** — **Status: open** (depends on T34)
  - All 7 "Done when" criteria unchecked
  
  **T36: Add `ralph reset` command** — **Status: open**
  - All 5 "Done when" criteria unchecked
  
  ### **Phase 8: Slack Integration**
  
  **T37–T41** — **Status: open** (all 5 tasks)
  - T37: Implement Slack webhook notifications (8 criteria)
  - T38: Implement thread tracking (7 criteria)
  - T39: Implement Slack Bot API notifications (6 criteria)
  - T40: Implement Socket Mode bot for replies (7 criteria)
  - T41: Integrate notifications into worker (8 criteria)
  
  ### **Phase 9: Release & Polish**
  
  **T42–T46** — **Status: open** (all 5 tasks)
  - T42: Set up GoReleaser (7 criteria)
  - T43: Set up Homebrew tap (5 criteria)
  - T44: Create comprehensive README (7 criteria)
  - T45: Add integration test suite (9 criteria)
  - T46: Update CLAUDE.md for Go version (5 criteria)
  
  ## Summary
  
  **13 tasks are not complete** (47% of 46 total tasks). T34 is the next task eligible to be picked (all its requirements T32 and T15 are complete), but it's blocked in the dependency chain since T35 requires both T34 and T33 (which IS complete).

  ## Why This Plan Was Flagged as Incomplete
  
  Despite 4 tasks being marked `complete` (T9, T25, T26, T27), **42 out of 46 tasks remain incomplete**. The vast majority of implementation work has not been started. Only the most basic Claude execution infrastructure (runner, timeout handling, completion detection, and blocker extraction) has been implemented. Critical foundational work like Go module initialization, CLI setup, configuration loading, and git operations are still pending.

  ## Summary
  
  **30 tasks are incomplete** across the plan:
  - **6 tasks in Phase 7** (Worker Queue) - T32, T33, T34, T35, T36, plus one more
  - **5 tasks in Phase 8** (Slack Integration) - T37-T41
  - **5 tasks in Phase 9** (Release & Polish) - T42-T46
  
  The blocking dependency chain starts at **T32** (Implement worker loop), which is the first incomplete task where all requirements are satisfied. It must be completed before T33, T34, and T35 can begin.

  - **All dependencies are complete** - this is the next task to work on
  - **Criteria not met:**
    - [ ] `internal/runner/loop.go` IterationLoop struct not defined
    - [ ] Run() function not implemented
    - [ ] All 8 subtasks incomplete

  ### Phase 8: Slack Integration
  
  **T37–T41: Slack Integration** (T37 requires T4✓)
  - All have open status
  - T37 (webhook) can start anytime (dependencies met)
  - T38–T41 form a chain of dependencies

  - No criteria met on any of them
  
  ---
  
  ## Summary
  
  **Next actionable task:** **T30** (Implement main iteration loop)
  - All its dependencies are complete
  - This unblocks T31, T32, and the rest of Phase 7
  
  **Can start anytime (dependencies met):**
  - T36 (ralph reset)
  - T37 (Slack webhook)
  - T42 (GoReleaser)
  
  The plan is well-structured. You're currently at the threshold between Phase 5 (Claude execution) and Phase 6 (Core Loop). T30 is the critical path item that will unlock execution of the entire iteration system.

  ## Why Flagged as Incomplete
  
  The plan shows **Status: pending** but has **28 complete tasks** (T1-T28, mostly Phase 1-5). The **18 remaining incomplete tasks** represent the core execution loop and all downstream features that depend on it. The essential infrastructure (config, git, CLI framework, Claude execution) is done, but the **worker queue** and **Slack integration** are entirely unimplemented. This likely explains why it was flagged—the Phase 6-9 work is critical to the system functioning end-to-end, and without the worker loop (T32), plans cannot actually execute.
